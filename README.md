## Project Overview
### Engine Used: Unreal Engine 5.2

## Introduction
Welcome to "I_Need_Healing", a lightweight mobile game that combines elements of tower defense and shooting.

Enemies are controlled by AiController and behavior trees, exhibiting autonomous attack functionality and simple retreat behavior.

In the game, enemies will gradually approach the main city from four directions, and failure will occur if the main city is breached! Try building additional defense towers on BuildTiles to resist enemy attacks. Your teammates will also assist you from the side, but if they get injured, they will continuously ask you for healing!!!

Remember! You are a doctor and cannot engage in attacks.
